## Trie Data Structure and Text System

### Overview
This project implements a robust **Trie** (prefix tree) data structure in Python, applying it to build a basic **auto-completion** and **spell-checking** system via a command-line interface (CLI). The Trie is highly efficient for prefix-based operations, providing **O(L)** complexity for insertion, search, and prefix checking, where $L$ is the length of the word/prefix.

### Project Deliverables
1.  `spell.py`: Complete source code for the Trie, data loading, and interactive CLI.
2.  `dictionary.txt`: The required dataset file (can be manually created or generated by the script on first run).
3.  `README.md`: This documentation file.
4.  `Test_Output.txt`: Example interactions demonstrating all functionality.

### How to Run
1.  **Save the Code:** Save the provided Python code as a single file named **`spell.py`**.
2.  **Execution:** Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python spell.py
    ```
3.  The system will initialize, load the dictionary, and enter the interactive `Trie-CLI>`. Type `help` to see available commands.

### Design Choices
* **Case Insensitivity:** All input and storage are converted to **lowercase** to ensure consistency.
* **Spell Check Algorithm:** The `spellCheck` function uses a simplified **one-edit distance** algorithm (generating words one insertion, deletion, transposition, or substitution away).
* **Auto-Complete Implementation:** The core `autoComplete` function is designed to return **all** matching words. The CLI then **limits the display to the first 10 suggestions** for a cleaner user experience, while informing the user if more matches exist.
* **CLI (Task 5):** The interactive loop and command parsing are fully implemented in the `run_cli` function, making the `spell.py` file a complete, standalone, runnable application.

### CLI Commands
| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **insert** | `insert <word>` | Adds a new word to the dictionary. |
| **search** | `search <word>` | Checks for exact word existence (case-insensitive). |
| **prefix** | `prefix <p>` | Checks if any word starts with prefix 'p'. |
| **auto** | `auto <p>` | Get auto-completion suggestions for prefix 'p'. |
| **spell** | `spell <word>` | Get spelling corrections (1-edit distance). |
| **help** | `help` | Show this command list. |
| **exit** | `exit` | Quit the program. |
